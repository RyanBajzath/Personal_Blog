# Personal_Blog

This will be a little project created to develop more fundanmental knowledge oh HTML, CSS and Javascript. The goal it to start simple and actually host a website for the public to see.

## HTML and hosting

I will start with just scripting a blog and then trying to bring it to life. I have made full stack apps before but I never hosted them. I also want to learn more HTML funndamentals.

## CSS

I also want to learn more styling, accessibility both with code and graphically. I want to learn different ways to make a pretty site and add the skills I learned in the E-Learning dev world.
