        <p>
          This photo was taken when I was in the army, Maybe around 19 years
          old. I was tasked with organizing and distributing ammo. I remeber I
          really wanted to smoke but smoking next to live ammo is not the best
          idea. This was my 1st real job and one of my life goals. I got to
          experience a pretty interesting life style and activities from being
          in nature for days on end, parachuting, learning how to use different
          firearms, tactics and teamwork. I also learned to move on and try
          other things as well.

          and said I am being promoted.
