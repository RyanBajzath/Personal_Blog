      Hello, my name is Ryan. I currently working as an Interactive Developper
      in the E-Learning space. I like to combine my passion for web dev and
      design. I have made Full-Stack websites before however I felt I skipped
      some steps with learning the fundamentals. I went straight into the MERN
      stack. I will give myself one month to get comfortable with HTML and CSS
      then another month with Javascript. I will create a front end webite then
      add APIs when needed, if needed. I also know the importance of always
      coding so I do not loose my skill.
