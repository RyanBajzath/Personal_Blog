        <h2>Army Time</h2>
        <img src="./img/army.png" alt="Selfie of when I was in the army" />
        <p>
          This photo was taken when I was in the army, Maybe around 19 years
          old. I was tasked with organizing and distributing ammo. I remeber I
          really wanted to smoke but smoking next to live ammo is not the best
          idea. This was my 1st real job and one of my life goals. I got to
          experience a pretty interesting life style and activities from being
          in nature for days on end, parachuting, learning how to use different
          firearms, tactics and teamwork. I also learned to move on and try
          other things as well.

        <img src="./img/movie.png" alt="photo taken when I was in a film" />
        <p>
          One cool thing I tried was acting in a film. I learned I do not like
          acting. I also have a deeper appreciation for such jobs.

        <h2>Taiwan Time</h2>
        <img src="./img/taiwan.png" alt="Me ontop of a mountain in taiwan" />
        <p>
          This photo was taken when I travelled to Taiwan to get married. It was
          quite a trip, different culture. I learned more about food and
          different perspectives on life. I am glad to be home but I miss it
          there. I did bring a piece of Taiwan home with me though... That being
          my wife, Ruru!
